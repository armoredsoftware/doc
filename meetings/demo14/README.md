* slides - beamer slides for the main presentation

The slide style is derived from a KU Beamer template that is an initial stab at a beamer template for producing slide presentations with a KU look, by Perry Alexander.  It is adapted from a similar package developed for Galois, Inc by Lee Pike and modified by Magnus Carlsson.  It assumes that you have installed the font Trebuchet MS, but I have never gotten this to work.
