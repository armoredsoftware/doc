\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The objective of \textsc{ArmoredSoftware} is to \emph{provide a portable
trusted computing capsule for applications executing in the cloud}.
This capsule, referred to as \emph{armor}, provides three major
functions:

\begin{description}
  \parskip=0pt\itemsep=0pt
\item[Appraisal] -- Request and assess measurement information from
  the operational environment and other armored components.
\item[Measurement] -- Gather run-time measurement information from its
  application
\item[Attestation] -- Assemble and deliver evidence to appraisers in a
  manner that assures measurement integrity
\end{description}

\noindent and is based on concepts from \citet{Coker::Principles-of-R}. 

Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} graphically depicts the major
architectural components of a protected application.  The
\emph{application} is the application to be protected by the
infrastructure.  The \emph{measurement} component performs measurement
operations on the running application while the \emph{attestation}
component gathers measurements and delivers them with cryptographic
assurance of integrity and confidentiality.  The \emph{appraisal}
component requests information from the environment and other
components to assess the overall operational environment.
\emph{Access control} governs access to all critical resources in the
protected application to assure secrets are preserved and enforce
information flow restrictions.

    major components of the remote attestation process.}
  \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:system} graphically represents the interaction among
protected components while Figure~\ref{fig:sequence} shows the
sequencing of interactions during appraisal.  A component's appraisal
module will request information from a second component's attestation
module.  The attestation model will select an attestation protocol
that instructs the measurer what information to gather and in what
sequence.  The measurer executes that protocol that in turn gathers
information from the running process, accesses the module's virtual
TPM (vTPM) and makes appraisal requests of other
\textsc{ArmoredSoftware} instances.  The attestation module assembles
measurement results into a evidence package that is returned to the
requesting appraiser with cryptographic assurances of integrity and
confidentiality as required.  Upon receiving the package, the
appraiser assesses cryptographic signatures and encryption to
determine the trustworthiness of the measurements, then assesses
measurements to determine the trustworthiness of the component being
appraised.\footnote{Note that the same process occurs when appraising
  the component's operational environment with either the appraiser or
  target replaced by operational infrastructure.}

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Measurement}

Figure~\ref{fig:measurement} graphically shows the processing of
requests for measurements by the measurement
component. Figure~\ref{fig:measurement-1} shows how a measurement
request is processed while Figure~\ref{fig:measurement-2} shows how a
response is generated.

The measurement component is a collection of measurement capabilities
for achieving various measurement goals.

Measurement selection chooses and instantiates a measurement
capability for a particular measurement task.

Measurement execution causes a measurement capability to execute,
manages execution and returns measurement results.

Measurement capabilities may need to access the vTPM for storing
measurement results, accessing stored results, or for generating
cryptographic evidence in support of assessment.

The measurement subsystem is protected by access control and is
responsible for protecting the application.

  \caption{Measurement request processing and response}
  \label{fig:measurement}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Attestation}

Figure~\ref{fig:attestation} graphically shows the processing of an
attestation request by an ArmoredSoftware attestation component.  The
attestation request specifies information requested by an appraiser.
Upon receipt, the \emph{Attestation Protocol Selector} or \emph{AP
  Selector} identifies one or more \emph{Attestation Protocols} that
could satisfy the appraisers request.  The protocol is passed to the
\emph{AP Instantiation} process that selects specific mechanisms for
achieving individual requests in the AP.  The resulting protocol
instance is passed to \emph{AP Execution} where it is executed by: (i)
making requests to the component's vTPM; making requests to another
components attestation service; or (iii) invoking the measurer on the
component's associated application.

\begin{figure}
\centering 
\subfigure[Request processing]{\includegraphics[width=0.450\textwidth]{figures/attestation-1.pdf}}
\subfigure[Response processing]{\includegraphics[width=0.450\textwidth]{figures/attestation-2.pdf}}
  \caption{Attestation request processing and response}
  \label{fig:attestation}
\end{figure}

The results of request to the vTPM, another attestation component, and
the local measurer are returned as vTPM quotes, evidence packages, and
measurements respectively.  The AP Execution component monitors
execution and collects various results for processing by the AP
Instantiation component.  AP Instantiation assembles individual
measurement, vTPM and appraisal results into a package representing
information requested in the attestation request.  The AP Selection
component uses cryptographic techniques to provide assurances to the
appraiser requesting information that evidence can be trusted.
Finally, the evidence package is returned to the requesting appraiser
where it is evaluated.
