\frame{\frametitle{Defining Trust}
  \begin{block}{Trust}
    ``An entity can be trusted if it always behaves in the exptected
    manner for the intended purpose~\cite{Martin:08:The-ten-page-in}''
  \end{block}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Defining Trust}
  \begin{block}{Properties}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Unambiguous identification
    \item Unimpeded operation
    \item First-hand observation of good behavior \emph{or} indirect
      experience of good behavior by a trusted third party
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Capabilities for Trust}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Strong Identification} --- An unambiguous, immutable
    identifier associated with the platform.  The identifier is a
    protected encryption key in the TXT implementation.
  \item \emph{Reporting Configuration} --- An unambiguous
    identification mechanism for software and hardware running on the
    platform.  The mechanism is hashing in the TXT implementation
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Trust is a Preorder}

  $\trusts{x}{y}$ is an homogeneous relation over actors that is true
  when \emph{x trusts y}.  $\trusts{x}{y}$ is a preorer:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reflexive - $\forall x \cdot \trusts{x}{x}$
  \item Transitive - $\forall x,y,z\cdot\trusts{y}{x} \wedge \trusts{z}{y} \Rightarrow
  \trusts{z}{x}$
  \end{itemize}

  The transitive property defines \emph{chains of trust}.
}

\frame{\frametitle{Roots of Trust} 

  A \emph{root of trust} provides a basis for transitively building
  trust.  Roots of trust are trusted implicitly.

  There are three important Roots of Trust:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM)
  \item Root of Trust for Reporting (RTR)
  \item Root of Trust for Storage (RTS)
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Root of Trust for Measurement}
  A \emph{Root of Trust for Measurement} is trusted to take the base
  system measurement.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Typically a hash function called on an initial code base from
    a protected execution environment
  \item In the Intel TXT process the RTM is \texttt{SENTER} implemented on the processor
  \item \texttt{SENTER} resets and measures \texttt{SINIT} into PCR 18
    in the TPM\footnote{`Measures X into PCR Y' informally means
      extending PCR Y with a hash of X.}
  \item \texttt{SENTER} runs securely on the Intel processor~\footnote{AMD has
      a similar command.  ARM does not.}
  \item Access control prevents access to PCR 18 by other instructions
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Root of Trust for Reporting}
  A \emph{Root of Trust for Reporting} is trusted to authenticate the
  base system report or quote

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Typically a key used for signing reports
  \item In the Intel TXT processes this is the TPM's Endorsement Key
    (EK)
  \item Created in the TPM factory and bound to its platform by a
    certificate
  \item $\private{EK}$ is stored in the TPM
  \item $\private{EK}$ cannot be accessed directly and can only be
    used by the TPM
  \item $\private{EK}$ is not used for signing, but for decrypting
    credentials
  \item $\public{EK}$ is maintained by a Certificate Authority
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Chaining Trust}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Trust is transitive
    \begin{itemize}
    \item $\trusts{x}{y} \wedge \trusts{y}{z} \Rightarrow
      \trusts{x}{z}$
    \item Construct chains of trust
    \item Remember ``directly observed or indirectly observed by a
      trusted third party''
    \end{itemize}
  \item Roots of Trust define the basis for trust
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use Roots of Trust to establish base for chain
    \item RTM generates a trusted first measurement
    \item RTS protects first measurement
    \item rtr signs base quote for appraiser
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Root of Trust for Storage}
  A \emph{Root of Trust for Reporting} is trusted to protect the
  base stored data

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Typically a key stored in a trusted location
  \item In the Intel TXT boot process this is the TPM's Storage Root
    Key (SRK)
  \item Created by TPM\_TakeOwnership
  \item $\private{SRK}$ is stored in the TPM
  \item $\private{SRK}$ cannot be accessed directly and can only be
    used by the TPM
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame{\frametitle{Building the Base}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Power On
    \begin{itemize}
    \item PCRs reset to -1
    \end{itemize}
  \item SENTER is called (RTM)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item SENTER resets PCRs to 0
    \item SENTER hashes SINIT into PCR 18 (RTS)
    \end{itemize}
  \item SINIT is called (Trusted)
  \end{enumerate}
}

}

\frame{\frametitle{Access Control Modeling Objectives}
  \framesubtitle{What we're about here}

  Reporting joint work with Geoffrey Brown, Indiana University (submitted) in which
  we verify two physical layer protocols.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Biphase Mark Protocol (BMP)
    \item 8N1 Protocol
  \end{itemize}

These protocols are used in data transmission for CDs, Ethernet, and Tokenring,
      etc. as well as UARTs.  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Correctness is reasonably difficult to prove due to many real-time constraints.

    \item Many previous formal modeling/verification efforts for these protocols.
  \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Previous Efforts}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item BMP has been verified in PVS twice and required
    \begin{itemize}
    \item  37 invariants and 4000 individual proof directives (initially) in the
      one effort
    \item 5 hours just to \emph{check} the proofs in the other effort
    \item A formal specification and verification of an independent real-time model
      in both efforts
    \end{itemize}
  \item BMP has been verified in (the precursor to) ACL2 by J. Moore and required
    \begin{itemize}
     \item A significant conceptual effort to fit the problem in the logic, arguably
       omitting some salient features of the model
     \item The statement and proof of many antecedent results
     \item J. Moore reports this as one of his ``best ideas'' in his career
    \end{itemize}
    
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Not Your Father's Theorem-Prover} 

The verifications are carried out in the SAL infinite-state bounded model-checker
that combines SAT-solving and SMT decision procedures to \emph{prove} safety
properties about infinite-state models.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Theorem-proving efforts took multiple engineer-months if not years to
      complete.

    \item Our initial effort in SAL consumed about \emph{two engineer-days}.\\
      ...and we found a significant bug in a UART application note.
  \end{itemize}
}


\frame[containsverbatim]{\frametitle{Parameterized Timing Constraints}
SMT allows for {\color{red}\emph{parameterized}} proofs of correctness.  The following are
example constaints from the BMP verification:
\begin{fnverbatim}
  TIME: TYPE = REAL;

  TPERIOD: TIME = 16;
  TSAMPLE: INTEGER = 23;
{\color{red}
  TSETTLE}: \{x: TIME |     0 <= x  
                      AND (x + TPERIOD < TSAMPLE) 
                      AND (x + TSAMPLE + 1 < 2 * TPERIOD)\};
{\color{red}
  TSTABLE}: TIME = TPERIOD - TSETTLE;
{\color{red}  
  ERROR}: \{x: TIME |     (0 <= x) 
                    AND (TPERIOD + TSETTLE < TSAMPLE*(1-x)) 
                    AND (TSAMPLE*(1+x) + (1+x) + TSETTLE < 2 * TPERIOD)\};

  RSAMPMAX: TIME = TSAMPLE * (1 + ERROR);
  RSAMPMIN: TIME = TSAMPLE * (1 - ERROR);

\frame[label=ta]{ \frametitle{Timeout Automata\footnote{B. Dutertre
  and M. Sorea.  Timed systems in SAL.  \emph{SRI TR}, 2004.} (Semantics)}

  An \emph{explicit} real-time model.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Vocabulary:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item A set of state variables.
    \item A \emph{global clock}, $c \in \rtime$.
    \item A set of \emph{timeout} variables $T$ such that for $t \in
      T$, $t \in \rtime$.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Construct a transition system $\mean{S, \, S^0, \, \rightarrow}$:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item States are mappings of all variables to values.
    \item Transitions are either \emph{time transitions} or
      \emph{discrete transitions}.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Time transitions are enabled if the clock is less than
          all timeouts.  Updates clock to least timeout.
        \item Discrete transitions are enabled if the clock equals
          some timeout.  Updates state variables and timeouts.
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\frame[containsverbatim]{\frametitle{Disjunctive Invariants} Even with $k$-induction, getting a
  sufficiently strong invariant is still hard!  \emph{Disjunctive invariants} help.
  A disjunctive invariant can be built iteratively from the counterexamples returned
  for the hypothesized invariant being verified.
