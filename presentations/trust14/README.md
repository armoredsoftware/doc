This is a slide presentation about Trust intended for tutorial style
presentatio in our ArmoredSoftware meetings.

The style is derived from a KU Beamer template that is an initial stab
at a beamer template for producing slide presentations with a KU look,
by Perry Alexander.  It is adapted from a similar package developed
for Galois, Inc by Lee Pike and modified by Magnus Carlsson.  It
assumes that you have installed the font Trebuchet MS, but I have
never gotten this to work.
