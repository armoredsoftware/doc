This is an initial stab at a beamer template for producing slide
presentations with a KU look, by Perry Alexander.  It is adapted from
a similar package developed for Galois, Inc by Lee Pike and modified
by Magnus Carlsson.  It assumes that you have installed the font
Trebuchet MS, but I have never gotten this to work.
